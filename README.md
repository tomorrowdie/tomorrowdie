👋 Hi, I’m John Chin (@tomorrowdie)

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I’m an Amazon Seller Trainer helping individuals and businesses improve their performance using cutting-edge technology. When I’m not teaching, I’m experimenting with Python or engaging in some good old gaming fun.
👀 I’m interested in:

    E-commerce optimization and business growth strategies.
    Leveraging Python for data analysis, automation, and creative problem-solving.
    Exploring emerging tech to empower small and large businesses.
    Casual gaming (especially Street Fighter 🎮). Zangief FTW!

🌱 I’m currently learning:

    Python Programming (projects include lottery simulators, tax calculators, and more).
    Data analytics and machine learning to extract insights for Amazon sellers.
    How to combine my love for gaming and tech into unique projects.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:

    Projects that optimize e-commerce businesses using data and automation.
    Creative Python-based tools for entrepreneurs and sellers.
    Anything related to tech, gaming, or innovative education solutions.
